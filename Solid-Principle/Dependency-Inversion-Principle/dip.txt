The Application should be de-couple , decoupling should be maintain so when we need to change
we can make it without any issue (Decoupling the Application)

We should make losely coupled
High level module should not import anything from low level module both should depend on the abstraction and interface
abstraction should not depend on the details (concrete implementation)

controller -> service -> repository (data layer) -> database

it will violate the dependency inversion rule

This is the Dependency inversion the dependency is inverted ( ulta gairaxa ) 
controller -> service -> interface -> repository -> database

controller -> interface -> service -> interface -> repository -> database
